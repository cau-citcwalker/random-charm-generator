# Extra model paths for ComfyUI
# Loaded automatically on startup
#
# Docker volume mounts the models directory at /app/ComfyUI/models
# so the default paths already work. This file is for additional paths.
#
# If running locally (non-Docker), uncomment and adjust:
# local:
#   base_path: ./
#   checkpoints: models/checkpoints/
#   loras: models/loras/
